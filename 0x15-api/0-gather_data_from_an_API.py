        - First line: Employee EMPLOYEE_NAME is done with...
          tasks(NUMBER_OF_DONE_TASKS/TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_TASKS):
            * EMPLOYEE_NAME: name of the employee.
            * NUMBER_OF_DONE_TASKS: number of completed tasks.
            * TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_TASKS: total number of tasks, which...
